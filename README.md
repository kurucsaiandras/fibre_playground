# Dense Fibre Composite Generation

## TODO list
(not necessarily in importance order)
 - Implement statistical descriptors for evaluation
    - For alignment, 3D density distrib. and curvature as well
    - Fibre trajectory plot
    - Make the evaluation automatic after every model save, also plot csv files after finish
 - Investigate inhomogenous distribution, touching fibres, clustering
    - The distributions in papers might be like that because of bundles -> ask
 - Try anisotropic misalignment
    - By reducing the volume unevenly
 - Try condition for angles on the edge, or just giving the fibres a bigger length than what fits
